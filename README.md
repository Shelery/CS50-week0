# CS50-week0
 In the movies sharks are often depicted as bloodthirsty monsters, dreadful lords of oceans.
 In my project the player is asked to help a shark to survive in the sea. It sounds silly and in fact the game is programmed to be quite easy in the beginning:
 After the player pressed "space", the shark is floating in the center of the display. The player must hover the mouse over to activate it. After that there is nothing more to do then moving the mouse and the shark is going to follow it.
 There are 3 types of "sprite" floating around: the fishernet, the plastic bags and the jellyfish.
 After each fishernet passing by without the shark getting caught, the player earns one point. If the shark touches the net, the game is over.
 On the other hand, if the shark touches a plastic bag, it loses one heart. If all the three hearts are gone, the game is over.
 The jellyfish are just floating around as a distraction as they might be confused with the plastic bags.

 So how can you win?
 It is easy: you can't.

 The programme is designed to have no postive outcome, meaning that the shark will sooner or later be caught by the net or will eat too much plastic. The screen is quite empty in the beginning but as the time passes by it becomes overcrowded making it almost impossible to avoid the threats.

 The goal of this game is to make the player realise: sharks are more vulnerable and endangered than what the mass media makes it look like.
